1. The total population exponentially increases until it hits the ceiling for population density prior to the introduction of the antibiotic.
2. The resistant population exponentially increases until it hits a lower ceiling than the total but follows a similar pattern prior to the introduction of the antibiotic.
3. The total population falls dramatically as soon as the antibiotic is introduced and then it flattens out.
4. The resistant population falls dramatically as soon as the antibiotic is introduced and then it flattens out in the same way that the total does.
